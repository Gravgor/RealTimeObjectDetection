# Real-Time Object Detection System in CUDA

![Object Detection Demo](demo.gif)

The Real-Time Object Detection System is a CUDA-accelerated project designed to detect objects in real-time video streams using deep learning models. Leveraging the power of NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA toolkit, this project achieves high-performance object detection with low latency.

## Features

- Real-time object detection in video streams.
- Utilizes CUDA-accelerated kernels for efficient computation on NVIDIA GPUs.
- Supports multiple object classes detection simultaneously.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction and visualization.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA Toolkit
- OpenCV
- Darknet neural network framework


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-Time-Object-Detection-CUDA.git
cd Real-Time-Object-Detection-CUDA
```

2. Run project via local debugger (for now)

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Provide the path to the input video file.
3. Watch as objects are detected in real-time.
4. Press 'Esc' to exit the application.
